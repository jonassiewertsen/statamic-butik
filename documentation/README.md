## A Statamic e-commerce solution

![Statamic 3.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statamic-3.0+-FF269E?style=for-the-badge&link=https://statamic.com) [![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://packagist.org/packages/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik)

_**butik**_ is a Scandinavian term for a small to medium-sized shop, precisely what this Statamic add-on has been created for. The _Statamic Butik_ e-commerce solution will work great together with your personal Statamic site and will help you expand your online business.

You can use the light and simple design as offered or customize it according to your needs to merge it optimally with your current design.

## Beta

_butik_ is an add-on for Statamic v3, which is currently in its beta phase. As long as Statamic v3 is in beta, you **should keep in mind that major changes during the development could lead to malfunctions in** _**Butik**_  **which we supervise and fix as soon as possible.**

### Stability

The current version is backed up by **350 PHPUnit tests** with **676 assertions** to monitor if things are working as expected.

When creating _Butik_ my highest goal was to provide a well functioning and fun to use e-commerce solution. _Butik_ is modeled after a Scandinavian mindset: starting as simple as possible with a solid foundation to continue from there on. Figuratively speaking: always keep in touch about the latest updates for the best user experience.
