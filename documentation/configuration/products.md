![](../.gitbook/assets/product-create.png)

To create a product, simply fill out all fields marked with a little red star. 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Field</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">product</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">The product name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">slug</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>A unique identifier for the product, which will be used to create the
          product url.</p>
        <p><em>butik will bark if the slug has already been taken.</em>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">price</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Product price including taxes.</p>
        <p><em>Use the without_tax modifier to show the price without taxes.</em>
        </p>

      <td style="text-align:left">Right now there is only <em>physical</em> available. Soon it will be possible
        to sell <em>digital</em> products as well.</td>

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| available | If deactivated, the product can't be bought and won't show up in the shop. |
| stock | How many items are available. |
| stock unlimited | Is there an unlimited amount of this product available? Be careful with this setting! |
| images | Images will help to sell your product. |

## Edit an existing product

After you saved your product, you will be redirected to the _edit view_ of your product.

![](../.gitbook/assets/product-edit.png)

This view is nearly identically with the create screen. Variations and categories can be edited from here as well. No hassle jumping to different views to edit a category, variation or similar.  

## Extend the product blueprint

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remove those and you will break everything for sure. 
{% endhint %}

![This is the minimum requirement](../.gitbook/assets/product-minimum-requirements.png)

Those are the minimum information _butik_ does need. We need a product price, a tax connected to the product, shipping information. 

### Required product fields

| Field | handle |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Titel** | title |
| **Price** | price |
| **Tax** | tax\_id |
| **Shipping** | shipping\_profile\_slug |
| **Description** | description |

### How to extend products

Open the product blueprint inside the control panel and add those fields you want to your product. That's it. Done.

##  Variants

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't want to use variants, remove the variants fieldtype from the product blueprint.
{% endhint %}

You can create different variants for your existing products. This might be useful for different cases, like selling T-shirts in different sizes. 

### Create a new variant

![You can inherit settings from the parent product ](../.gitbook/assets/product-variants-create.png)

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **available** | If deactivated, this variant can not be bought or won't be shown. |
| **name** | Choose a short and unambiguous name for your variant. |
| **link price** | Do you want to **inherit** the price or use another price? |
| **price** | Will only show up if prices are not linked. |
| **inherit stock** | **Do you want to inherit the stock from your parents?** |
| **stock** | **Only visible if not inherited from the parent.** |
| **stock unlimited** | Do you have unlimited products? Be careful with this setting. |

### Manage existing variants

![This overview will be shown on the product edit view.](../.gitbook/assets/product-variants-overview.png)

## Categories

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't want to use categories, remove the variants fieldtype from the product blueprint.
{% endhint %}

Your shop does work perfectly without any categories. In case you\`re having a huge range of products, categories will help your customers find what they need faster. 

### Create a new category

![Create a new categorie on the go](../.gitbook/assets/product-categories-add.png)

 Simply create a new category when editing your product. 

### Manage existing categories

![Simply use toggles](../.gitbook/assets/product-categories.png)

Use the toggles to connect your product to one or multiple categories. That's really everything there is to it. 

{% hint style="info" %}
As soon as you add any category, links will get visibly in our default shop templates to browse products in the _belonging_ categories.
{% endhint %}
