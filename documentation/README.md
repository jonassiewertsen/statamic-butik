## A Statamic e-commerce solution

![Statamic 3.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statamic-3.0+-FF269E?style=for-the-badge&link=https://statamic.com) [![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://packagist.org/packages/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik)

_**butik**_ is a Scandinavian term for a small to medium-sized shop, precisely what this Statamic add-on has been created for. The _Statamic Butik_ e-commerce solution will work great together with your personal Statamic site and will help you expand your online business.

You can use the light and simple design as offered or customize it according to your needs to merge it optimally with your current design.
